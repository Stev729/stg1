Hi, did you make it? Then good. This is where I provide you the next clue right? Please wait for a moment...

"Sa, wziel pdow rsp'zw uizr lkmxoww!"



Did you get it? Can't get it? Not get it?



Dissapointing... Isn't it? Steve didn't gave you the key? Coincidentically, maybe Steve 'is' the key! Oh, you already did that?
Really? Damn it. Apparently, it was a troll. Probably something was overlooked. Potentially it's all given to you!  



Come on! Out of ideas? Makes me sad indeed.



Ask others. Talking might work. Two brains are better than one after all. Argh!!! Can't think much more to say. Here's a poem I guess.

``  Make your way foward,
    Engage challenges too!
    Never gonna give you up!
    This is a Rick Roll for you. ``

Seeya!
